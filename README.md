# Puppycam for SM64

Puppycam is a brand new camera mode for SM64, designed from the ground up, to improve and fix all of the existing flaws with the horribly dated camera, that comes with the original game.

# Features:

 - It features movement on both the X and Y axis, as well as accurate raycasting collision that prevents the camera from ever getting stuck, while retaining its absolute formost in staying within the level boundaries.
- It also features a whole range of different behavioural flags that dictate how the camera itself will operate, based on what you decide to set.
- It has a dynamic options menu, that is incredibly easy to add, or take away options for.
- Support for a player 2 joystick, for emulator users, to allow for analogue camera control.
